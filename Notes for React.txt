ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6.
Is a way to standardize JavaScript.

Simple class constructor with es6

class Car {
	constructor(name) {
		this.brand = name;
	}

	 present() {
    	return 'I have a ' + this.brand;
  	}
}

Instead of using the keyword function use class. And the properties are assigned inside the constructor method.

The line below creates an object using the car class.
const mycar = new Car("Ford");

The line below display a method call from the class on the object.
mycar.present();

Similar to Java you can achieve class inheritance using the keyword extends.

class Model extends Car {
  constructor(name, mod) {
    super(name);
    this.model = mod;
  }  
  show() {
      return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model
  }
}
const mycar = new Model("Ford", "Mustang");
mycar.show();

This code uses the Car class as a superclass would in Java
The line super(name); calls the constructor method in the parent class.
